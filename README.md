# Nicer Editing

This [Wolf CMS](http://www.wolfcms.org/) plugin adds a nicer [Code Mirror](http://codemirror.net/) text editor on the backend so you don't need to deal with the default awefulness.

# Installation

Easy peasy.

1. Copy the codemirror folder into your Plugins/ folder.
2. Activate the plugin on the backend

# Limitations

- Doesn't have any configuration options yet.
- Highlighting is hard-coded to GitHub flavored markdown.
